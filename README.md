# SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction
Brief Explanation-
Suppose there is a war going on between two countries,submarine of a country is going under water to another country and the enemy country have planted some mines in the ocean(mines are nothing but explosives that explodes when some object comes in contact with it) and there can also be rocks in the ocean.
So submarine needs to predict whether it is crossing a mine or a rock.
Here our job is to make a system that can predict whether the object beneath the submarine is a mine or a rock
